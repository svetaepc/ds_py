\\\" \\nhave you seen \\\" event horizon \\\" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \\ngood . \\nthen you've seen \\\" supernova . \\\" \\npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \\nafter all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain . \\nbut the bigger problem with \\\" supernova \\\" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded . \\nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \\nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \\ndid the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? \\nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \\nand just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? \\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\nbassett and spader's characters start off hating each other . \\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky . \\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\nmaybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\ndoesn't make sense . \\nsince i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\nnot a whit . \\nit's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\nthey don't find it . \\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\nsexual tension ? \\nmore like constipation . \\nmaybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \\\" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \\\" \\nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper . \\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\nhe' s awfully one-note , but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with . \\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\nphillips broods . \\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then . \\n \\\" supernova \\\" is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\nthat's it . \\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will . \\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film . \\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \\nit usually results in a bad movie , and that's what \\\" supernova \\\" is . \\n\",\n          \"a big surprise to me . \\nthe good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . \\nthey replaced him just fine . \\nnot with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing . \\nthe fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten . \\nthis was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) . \\nthings that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all . \\ni'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing . \\nthere's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops . \\nit's just the music . \\none of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this . \\nthe music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing , all the musicians do a great job . \\nthe only real problems i had was the special effects . \\nthese were superfluous and a waste of money . \\nsince the film isn't doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see . \\nthe bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide . \\n-- http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/academy/8034/ \\nremove no spam to reply . \\n \\\" drive carefully but recklessly \\\" , mama , child's toy \\\" the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise . \\\" \\npeter o'toole \\n\",\n          \"susan granger's review of \\\" glitter \\\" ( 20th century-fox ) \\nthere's less here than meets the eye . \\nor , put it this way , if you thought madonna was awful in \\\" shanghai surprise , \\\" mariah carey's worse in this reworking of \\\" a star is born . \\\" \\nshe plays billie frank who , despite being abandoned by her singer/alcoholic mother ( valerie pettiford ) , believes she's destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is . \\n \\\" you've got this amazing gift , and you gotta use it , \\\" her roommate says . \\n \\\" your voice - it's incredible , \\\" says another singer . \\n \\\" i ain't never met anyone like you , \\\" proclaims julian \\\" dice \\\" black ( max beesley ) , the hot new york dj who becomes her svengali-like producer/lover . \\nproblem is : her signature song , \\\" i didn't mean to turn you on \\\" is wretched . \\nand when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to \\\" exploit \\\" her by having her wear a bikini , the audience bursts into laughter . \\nexploit mariah carey , who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow ?

look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . \\nif that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : \\\" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to . \\\" \\nbut i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . \\nso i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . \\nyou know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . \\nsometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . \\nadmit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . \\nso do i . \\nso i saw \\\" supernova . \\\" \\ntruth be told , \\\" supernova \\\" wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be . \\nmaybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . \\nmaybe i'm becoming a softy . \\nin any case , i didn't find \\\" supernova \\\" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . \\nbut it's still bad . \\nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel \\\" nightingale . \\\" \\nthe crew includes captain a . j . \\nmarley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . \\nthere are some attempts at \\\" characterization , \\\" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . \\ndon't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it . \\nanyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . \\nduring the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . \\nhe calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . \\nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . \\nhave you seen \\\" alien ? \\\" \\nhave you seen \\\" event horizon \\\" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \\ngood . \\nthen you've seen \\\" supernova . \\\" \\npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \\nafter all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain . \\nbut the bigger problem with \\\" supernova \\\" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded . \\nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \\nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \\ndid the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? \\nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \\nand just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? \\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\nbassett and spader's characters start off hating each other . \\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky . \\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\nmaybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\ndoesn't make sense . \\nsince i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\nnot a whit . \\nit's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\nthey don't find it . \\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\nsexual tension

that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper . \\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\nhe' s awfully one-note , but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with . \\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\nphillips broods . \\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then . \\n \\\" supernova \\\" is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\nthat's it . \\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will . \\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film . \\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \\nit usually results in a bad movie , and that's what \\\" supernova \\\" is . \\n\",\n          \"a big surprise to me . \\nthe good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . \\nthey replaced him just fine . \\nnot with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing . \\nthe fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten . \\nthis was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) . \\nthings that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all . \\ni'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing . \\nthere's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops . \\nit's just the music . \\none of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this . \\nthe music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing , all the musicians do a great job . \\nthe only real problems i had was the special effects . \\nthese were superfluous and a waste of money . \\nsince the film isn't doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see . \\nthe bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide . \\n-- http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/academy/8034/

\\\" shanghai surprise , \\\" mariah carey's worse in this reworking of \\\" a star is born . \\\" \\nshe plays billie frank who , despite being abandoned by her singer/alcoholic mother ( valerie

producer/lover . \\nproblem is : her signature song , \\\" i didn't mean to turn you on \\\" is wretched . \\nand when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to \\\" exploit \\\" her by having her wear a bikini , the audience bursts into laughter . \\nexploit mariah carey , who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow ? \\ncome on ! \\nwriter kate lanier's script is fatuous and director vondie curtis-hall doesn't have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and , as a result of their incompetence , whispery-voice'd ms . carey seems to be embarrassed on-screen . \\nshe almost cringes when the camera comes in for a close-up , pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes . \\ntalented british musician max beesley appears equally inept , and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline , there's an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view . \\nperhaps one of the reasons ms

the films that spawned them , but the fact that \\\" species ii \\\" is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable . \\nit's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction . \\nthe plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle . \\nthe slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black . \\nthat should have been the end of the movie right there . \\nback on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate . \\non a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again \\\" played \\\" by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing . \\nthis , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to \\\" the dukes of hazzard \\\" tv show , which she appears to enjoy . \\neve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk \\\" mates , \\\" which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) . \\neve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on . \\npeter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams \\\" i told 'em not to go ! \\\" \\nat the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle . \\nmichael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns . \\nthey're both unbelievably wooden . \\nwhat's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( \\\" the ruling class , \\\" \\\" the krays , \\\" \\\" let him have it \\\" ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder . \\nit's an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like \\\" species ii . \\\" \\nlast year peter hyams gave us \\\" the relic \\\" ; no thanks necessary there . \\nand the first \\\" species \\\" was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects . \\nis it just that there are no better offers out there ? \\n \\\" species ii \\\" is worthless . \\nworse than that , it's also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn . \\nit's not that there isn't anything positive to say about the film . \\nthere is . \\nafter 92 minutes , it ends . \\n\",\n          \"there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort . \\noften a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . \\nwhen one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . \\nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with \\\" the hurricane . \\\" \\nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin \\\" hurricane \\\" carter would normally be called \\\" norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' \\\" as per the tradition of referring to a film \\\" belonging \\\" to a director . \\nbut though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of \\\" the hurricane , \\\" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . \\nwashington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar . \\njailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . \\nthe situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . \\nthrough the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . \\nthe film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . \\nwhen he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . \\ndespite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . \\nflash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . \\nthe book , entitled \\\" the sixteenth round , \\\" opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . \\nlesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \\n \\\" the hurricane \\\" leans on denzel washington . \\nhe must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . \\nit's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . \\nit would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film . \\nthe actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm's length . \\nwe feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . \\nwashington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth . \\nhe doesn't merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . \\nhis work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . \\nnorman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \\n \\\" the hurricane \\\" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . \\njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . \\nhis boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from \\\" raging bull , \\\" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . \\njewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . \\njewison's best achievement in \\\" the hurricane \\\" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . \\nsadly , though , the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter . \\nthere is much to interest a viewer in \\\" the hurricane , \\\" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . \\ntake a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . \\ncarter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . \\nthe canadians are good . \\nthe cops are bad . \\nthe canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film's failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya's ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . \\nmuch of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( \\\" hate put me in prison . \\nlove's gonna bust me out . \\\" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special . \\nit's too bad . \\nthe cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . \\ni wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than \\\" he's a racist pig . \\\" \\ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . \\nin short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . \\ncriticism has been levied against the liberties \\\" the hurricane \\\" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . \\nfor example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . \\nmost accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . \\nfurthermore , much of carter's criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . \\nof course , \\\" the hurricane \\\" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don't remove one fact : \\\" the hurricane \\\" is a highly flawed film . \\nonly one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it's a good thing \\\" the hurricane \\\" has that actor . \\ncarter has been quoted as saying , \\\" denzel washington is making me look good , \\\" but he's not the only one . \\nwashington makes this film look good . \\ndenzel washington's \\\" the hurricane . \\\" \\nsounds pretty good to me . \\n\",\n          \"starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz \\npermanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this . \\nthe film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . \\n ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ) \\nultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . \\nben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit . \\nhe eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for \\\" alf \\\" : chompers looks just like alf except he's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . \\ninsert proverbial downward spiral here . \\npermanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . \\ni've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . \\nas stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . \\nwhat separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . \\nwatch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! \\nwatch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! \\nstiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . \\nbut permanent midnight is mostly soulless . \\nwhen the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? \\nand then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? \\nin the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . \\nif you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man . \\n ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . \\nis this hollywood . . . california ? ) \\ni learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . \\nof course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . \\nso , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he's apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . \\nso much for the moral of that story . \\ntemporary midnight is more like it . \\n-bill chambers
